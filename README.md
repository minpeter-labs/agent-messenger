## Why Agent Messenger?

Messaging platforms only offer Bot tokens for API access—your AI agent can never act **as you**. Agent Messenger extracts user credentials directly from your installed desktop apps, letting your agent operate on your behalf. Bot tokens are fully supported too for server-side and CI/CD use cases.

- **Act as yourself, not a bot** — Extracted user tokens let your agent operate on your behalf
- **No API keys needed** — Automatically extracts credentials from your installed desktop apps
- **Zero setup** — Credentials are auto-extracted on first command. No manual auth step required
- **One interface, multiple platforms** — Learn once, use everywhere (Slack, Discord, Teams)
- **AI-agent friendly** — JSON output by default, perfect for LLM tool use
- **Agent memory** — Remembers workspace IDs, channel names, and preferences across sessions
- **Human friendly too** — Add `--pretty` for readable output
- **Token efficient** — CLI, not MCP. Load only what you need. ([Why not MCP?](#philosophy))

```bash
npm install -g agent-messenger
```

Or use your favorite package manager.

This installs:

- `agent-slack` — Slack CLI (user token, zero-config)
- `agent-slackbot` — Slack Bot CLI (bot token, for server-side/CI/CD)

## Agent Skills

Agent Messenger includes [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) that teach your AI agent how to use these CLIs effectively.

- **`agent-slack`** — Slack (user token, zero-config)
- **`agent-slackbot`** — Slack Bot (bot token, for server-side/CI/CD)
- **`agent-discord`** — Discord (user token, zero-config)

- **`agent-teams`** — Microsoft Teams (user token, zero-config)
- **`agent-telegram`** — Telegram (user account via TDLib)

### SkillPad

SkillPad is a GUI app for Agent Skills. See [skillpad.dev](https://skillpad.dev/) for more details.

### Skills CLI

Skills CLI is a CLI tool for Agent Skills. See [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) for more details.

```bash
npx -y skills add devxoul/agent-messenger
```

### Claude Code Plugin

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add devxoul/agent-messenger
claude plugin install agent-messenger
```

Or within Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add devxoul/agent-messenger
/plugin install agent-messenger
```

### OpenCode Plugin

Add to your `opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": ["agent-messenger"],
}
```

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 30 seconds:

```bash
# 1. See your workspace at a glance
agent-slack snapshot --pretty

# 2. Send a message
agent-slack message send general "Hello from the CLI!"
```

That's it for Slack, Discord, Teams, and their bot variants. Telegram additionally uses TDLib plus your own `api_id` and `api_hash`.

## Telegram Quick Start

```bash
AGENT_TELEGRAM_API_ID=<api-id> \
AGENT_TELEGRAM_API_HASH=<api-hash> \
bunx --package agent-messenger agent-telegram auth login

# Send a message
bunx --package agent-messenger agent-telegram message send <chat-id-or-@username> "Hello from the CLI!"
```

If the env vars are missing, the CLI will prompt for them and store them locally for reuse. The official configuration path is still `AGENT_TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `AGENT_TELEGRAM_API_HASH`.

## Use Cases

### Gathering Context

Pull context from conversations before you start working — no tab-switching, no skimming.

> "Read the #incident-api-outage thread in Slack and summarize the root cause, timeline, and action items so I can write the postmortem."

> "Search our Discord #architecture channel for any previous discussion about event sourcing before I write a proposal."

> "Check my unread messages across all Slack channels and tell me if anything needs my attention."

> "Look through #frontend in Slack for messages about the login page redesign from the past two weeks and summarize the decisions made."

> "Search Teams for any messages mentioning 'API deprecation' so I know if this was discussed before."

### Communicating & Reporting

Send updates, file reports, and notify your team — all from a prompt.

> "Post a deployment summary to #releases in Slack with the commit hash, changelog, and deploy status."

> "Send a message to the #standup channel with what I worked on yesterday, what I'm doing today, and any blockers."

> "Cross-post this announcement to #general in Slack, the announcements channel in Discord, and the General channel in Teams."

> "Upload the latest test coverage report to #ci-results in Slack."

> "React with ✅ to the last message in #deploy-requests to confirm I've handled it."

### Automation & Pipelines

Wire messaging into your CI, scripts, or agent workflows.

> "After every CI run, post the build status and test results to #builds in Slack — include the branch name and commit link."

> "When a long-running migration finishes, notify me in Discord with the final row count and elapsed time."

> "Every morning at 9am, snapshot my Slack workspace and post a summary of active channels to #team-pulse."

> "Send an alert to #oncall in Slack whenever the error rate exceeds 1% — include the service name and a link to the dashboard."

> "Read the latest message in #releases, then cross-post it to our Discord announcements channel."

### ...and More

These are just starting points. Your agent has full read/write access to Slack, Discord, and Teams — anything you'd do manually in a chat app, it can handle for you. If you build something cool with Agent Messenger, [let me know](https://x.com/devxoul)!

## Philosophy

**Why not MCP?** MCP servers expose all tools at once, bloating context and confusing agents. **[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) + agent-friendly CLI** offer a better approach—load what you need, when you need it. Fewer tokens, cleaner context, better output.

**Why not OAuth?** OAuth requires an app and it requires workspace admin approval to install, which can take days. This tool just works—zero setup required. For those who prefer bot tokens (e.g., server-side or CI/CD), see [`agent-slackbot`](skills/agent-slackbot/SKILL.md).
